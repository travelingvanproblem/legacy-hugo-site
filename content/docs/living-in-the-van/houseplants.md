## Why it might be challenging to have houseplants in a van?

![Houseplants in the van attached to countertop with magnets](images/guidebook/plants/magneettikiinnitys.jpg "")

Living conditions in the van are quite special compared to a normal apartment.
- Not that much natural light
- Moving home for the plants and possibly mold everywhere
- Changing temperatures
- Only a small space to share with humans 

## What houseplants do we have in our car?

### The best one - *Golden Pothos (Epipremnum Aureum)* 

![Golden Pothos in the van on top of a small corner shelf](images/guidebook/plants/kultakoynnos.jpg "In our van *Golden Pothos* is living on top of a small corner shelf.")

This one is almost impossible to kill. Be careful, because *Golden Pothos* is mildly poisonous to pets. The liquid from the plant might also irritate human skin.

#### How to take care of
🌤️ Partly cloudy (tip- more light gives more light stripes)

💧They don't need much watering. Allow the soil surface to dry completely between waterings

Brown spots- not enough water

Yellow leaves-too much water

### *Snake Plant (Sansevieria Trifasciata)* 

![Snake Plant hanging in makramee hanger](images/guidebook/plants/anopinkieli.jpg "Our *Snake Plant* in the makramee hanger.")

This one barely ever gets any pests. It also needs very little light and water but it does not like cold.

#### How to take care of
🌤️🌞 It thrives in direct sunlight or shade

💧They don't need much watering. 

The only way to kill it is to overwater it.

### *Money Tree (Crassula Ovata)*

![Money Tree before we moved to a van](images/guidebook/plants/rahapuu.jpg "Our *Money Tree* before we moved to a van.")

![Money Tree after three months in a van](images/guidebook/plants/rahapuuautossa.jpg "Our *Money Tree* after three months in a van.")

This can survive cold temperatures for short periods if the soil is dry.
They are a bit more fragile if you think about the constant movement of the van.

#### How to take care of
⛅️🌞 It is okay with shade but likes a more sunny place

💧They don't need much watering

Dry room air is the best for them

## What houseplants we would try as well for Vanlife?

*Spider Plant (Chlorophytum)* is a really easy plant that also makes flowers sometimes. It enjoys direct sunlight but prefers partly cloudy. The only minus is that *Spider Plant* might grow too fast and too big for the van.

*Eternity Plant (Zamioculcas Zamiifolia)* you can keep alive even in bathrooms. The only minus is that they are usually too big for vans.

*Air Plants* adapt to new places better than most plants. They don't need soil. They are so-called independent because they do not require much care.

*Aloe Vera* does not need much water and is easy to take care of.

## Tips for taking care of the plants in a van
- Don’t move the plant inside the van too often. Try to find a stable place for the plant so that it stays in the same chosen spot all the time. Choose a place where the plant is not on your way during your daily routines.

- Don’t put houseplants too close to the window. Yes, they need natural light but if you are traveling when it is colder they will freeze when living next to a window.

- Don’t water the plants too often and water only with lukewarm water.

- Spray plants sometimes with water because the air might be dry inside the van. 

## Where to put them in the van?
**Shelf** Plants won't be on your way but you have to drill holes to the wall.

**Magnets** Attach the houseplant to the countertop with strong magnets. Make sure that you have strong enough magnets since a pot full of soil is quite heavy and you want it to stay in its place while driving.

**Macrame hanger**  The plant will probably get a bit more damaged when swinging while driving.

## Recommended items that you might need with plants
Our ultimate favourites are *Elho* products. They are pretty, affordable, and light. They are made from plastic so they won't leak and you can't easily break them. In most of the pots, the plastic is recycled. We also use *Elho* spray bottle for taking care of the plants. 





The answer to our question is yes. You can have houseplants in your van quite easily. You just have to find a good spot for them. We had over 50 houseplants and nowadays we only have three. In the future hopefully more!
