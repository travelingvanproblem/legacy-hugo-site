description: "What toilet options do we have available for a van? What option did we choose?"
---

After driving around Rome with a rental van trying to find a place to empty the cassette toilet, we decided we would never get one in our own van. The idea was sealed when we finally found a place to dump the black water. The place was disgusting. There was human excrement everywhere and the smell was terrible. We knew that we would not get a cassette toilet to our future home on wheels. Next, we started to explore options.


## What options do we have?

1. *Portable camping toilets* are light, but most of them have all the stuff going in the same place, which might cause more smell.

2. *Cassette toilets* may only be emptied into certain marked black water emptying stations, but they cause less odor than other toilet options. The chemical capsule that is put in them must be changed approximately every five days. Sometimes they may become clogged with 💩 during emptying.

3. *Composting toilets* are easy to empty, but you must do it more often because they start to smell faster.

4. Or *no toilets and only a shovel* might be good option in nature but in cities and villages you may have problems finding a public toilet or a bush for privacy. The plus side is that your camper will have more space for other things.


## Which option did we choose and why?

## How to use the Trelino composting toilet?
Just open the lid and take care of your needs. Protect the 💩 container with a compostable bag. Be careful not to put wet towels in 💩 bin, which will hinder the composting process. With 💩, you just put compost soil in the trash can and close it with a lid after your needs. When the litter box needs to be emptied, you lift the lid of the entire litter box, carry the contents of the pee container to nature, and the number 2 container bag to the garbage.

##### Cleaning tips
We clean our Trelino every time we empty it. That is, about every other day. Here's how we do it:

1. Rinse the pee container with water

2. Wipe the toilet with antibacterial wipes inside and out

3. Spray a vinegar-based detergent and wipe it off. Vinegar helps with odors.(A tip- make your own detergent by mixing water/vinegar/essential oil/Fairy).

4. Allow all the parts to dry before putting them back in place
