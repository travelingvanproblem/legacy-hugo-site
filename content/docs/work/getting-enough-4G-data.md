## Using 4G for the work
Our van doesn't have fancy electric system to support Starlink so we decided to use our smart phones as hotspots for our work. Onni is working as software engineering team lead and Meri is providing finnish lessons remotely. We both needed low latency for video calls and since 4G is very widely available in Europe it was easy choice for us.

This means that before parking for the night we need to ensure that there's good enough 4G speeds to do work on our laptops the next day. Usually this means that ping should be under 150ms and that there's at least 10mbps download and upload speed.

## Do you need unlimited data?

We are from Finland üá´üáÆ and we are used to having unlimited data with very cheap prices. For example in 2023 we have been using mobile subscription from DNA for 26‚Ç¨ per month. This contains unlimited 4G data with full speed in Nordics + Baltics and plenty of phone calls and 32gb monthly data in other European countries.

We started our Vanlife trip from the Nordics so we knew we had enough data to use Google meet for video conferencing and streaming shows from Netflix. **We noticed that we needed 70-90 gigabytes of mobile data per month.** Using this amount from our own phones would be really expensive after going from Denmark üá©üá∞ to Germany üá©üá™.

## Testing different providers
### ConnectPls

The first company we tested was [ConnectPls](https://connectpls.com/).

They have [eSIM](https://connectpls.com/e-sim/) and [physical SIM card options](https://connectpls.com/sim-card-only/) which both cost 59¬£ per month which at the time of writing this was ~69‚Ç¨. Physical SIM card contains 400gb of data and eSIM 200gb so both should be more than enough for us.

Nice thing about their service is that you can cancel anytime and they have automated the payments of your subscription and charge your credit card monthly.

Since both options were similiarly priced we wanted to get the physical one. After ordering they contacted us through email and arranged delivery to a poste restante address in Germany using DHL Express.

I needed to enable data roaming in the settings and then we had blazing fast 200mbps download speeds üöÄ.

We used the SIM card for 3 weeks and then suddenly it stopped working. Luckily we had second mobile subscription still and were able to connect ConnectPls Support using WhatsApp. They then send us the replacement eSIM QR-code and it worked immediately.

Their monthly fee is pretty high and the suddenly dying SIM card did not make us too happy so we started to look for different options

### 4gsim.es

We noticed that ConnectPls uses Movistar SIM cards which is a spanish company. When we searched for alternatives providing 400gb Movistar cards we found [4gsim.es](https://4gsim.es/?ref=Onni).

They provided exactly same service but just for less money and we were happy to start using them instead.
