{{< alert icon="ðŸ’¸" context="info" text="TL;DR: If you don't get the above green sticker into your car you can get a fine up to 100â‚¬ when driving in German or Austrian city centers" />}}

When we were traveling at Germany in 2023 autumn we noticed that our navigation app Waze started to mention that we can't enter certain `Umwelt` zones without a special sticker.

You can read more at [www.germanemissionssticker.com](https://www.germanemissionssticker.com) but in short many bigger cities in Germany and Austria have "low emission zones" where you can't drive a vehicle that doesn't meet EURO 4 emission standard (or EURO 6 in few specific streets in few biggest cities).

You can order this sticker before starting to live in a van full time or if you were like us and noticed this too late you can buy them by visiting a vehicle inspection company such as DEKRA or TÃœV. Make sure you bring your vehicle registration certificate and ask for an `Umweltplakette`.
